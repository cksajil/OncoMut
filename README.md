Predicting Genetic Mutations as Primary or Metastasis Using Deep Learning


The open clinical research data called Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) is used in this study to predict a given mutation is of type primary or metastasis using Deep Neural Network (DNN) Models. Multiple DNNs has been tried along with feature engineering. The model performance is compared to select the best performing model.
